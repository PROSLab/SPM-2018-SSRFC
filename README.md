# VuGit: your online repository for .bpmn models



## Project description
This repository contains the SPM Project work of SSRFC group composed by Scala Simone, Scala Emanuele, Rosati Marcello, Fedeli Arianna and Calise Francesco, under the supervision of professors Morichetta Andrea and Fornari Fabrizio. The project consists of a web platform called VuGit which allows users to register and access the different .bpmn files uploaded to the platform repositories. 
Briefly, each registered user has a private repository accessible only to that user, while he can have access to all public repositories also of other users. Within a repository the user can create a .bpmn file, create folders, delete files, move folders... almost like Google Drive. The most important thing is that for the same .bpmn file, the user can create different versions, then work on the desired version in order to have a history of the changes made to the same .bpmn model. User can open the desired version of the .bpmn file in the bpmn.io editor built-in inside the platform, or download directly this version, or a collection of versions for the same model, to his local machine. Once the model is open on the bpmn.io editor, the user can check the validity and soundness of the model and see the results shown. The registered user will have at his disposal a search bar to search for a bpmn model in a repository and will be able to share his own models with other users.
